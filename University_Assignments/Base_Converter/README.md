###Synopsis

Given a number m in base b, with integer par X[ ] and fractional part Y[ ] : m = (X.Y)_b  
Return m in base r with integer part U[ ], fractional non repeating part V[ ] and repeating part W[ ] : m = (U.VW)_r

####Notes
-  Bases will range from [2 - 60]
-  We must implement our own operations ( + - * / ) for large inputs
